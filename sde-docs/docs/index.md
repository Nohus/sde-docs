# Static Data Export (SDE)

The [SDE](https://developers.eveonline.com/docs/services/sde/) is an export of static game data provided by CCP.

This website documents the schema of the [JSONL](https://jsonlines.org) files it is available in. It is generated and published automatically whenever a new version of the SDE is released, so it is always up to date.
